    description: 'React is a really good framework, but so gigantic that somehow you can´t know everything. Single page application or do you prefer multipage? Not an issue with react. What you need is installed, what you don´t need is simply left out. Unfortunately, since React is so gigantic, I can´t do everything. What I can do ranges from components, whether functional or class-based, to higher order components, hooks or the classic life cycle implementations. Since JSX is a mixture of HTML and Javascript, its use is also not a problem.'
